Asciidoctor Maven Bootstrap
===========================

Why? Because you totally don't want to author documents in Word. Especially if you collaborate.

This project provides a simplistic Framework to write articles and documentation in Asciidoc.
No setup is required, the only prerequisite is Maven. It allows for roundtripping, i.e., assemblies created 
using this archetype are self contained and can recreate themselves. Useful if you lost the original sources ...


Examples
--------
You do not need to be an Ascii Art fetishist:

But you can include code snippets which will be highlighted nicely:
[source,ruby]
include::snippets/extensions.rb[]

[source,java]
include::snippets/mvn-plugin-execute.java[]

Of course you can also have the code inline (with beautiful callouts):
[source,ruby]
----
require 'sinatra' <1>

get '/hi' do      <2>
  "Hello World!"  <3>
end
----
<1> Library import
<2> URL mapping
<3> Content for response


How to use
----------

* generate project from archetype
* mvn clean install
* The rendered documents are found in target/generated-docs
